## Introduction

This repository holds my solutions for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Laboratory at IIIT Bhubaneswar. Every lab session gets its own folder, and
inside that, every question gets its own subfolder holding the source file
for that question plus anything it generates (CSV data, PNG plots).

Most of these questions ask for more than "does it run" — they ask what
happens as `n` grows. So the programs here do two jobs: solve the problem,
and instrument it — counting comparisons, counting moves, tabulating values
across a range of `n` — then export that data as CSV so the growth can be
plotted rather than just asserted.

## About the Repository

- Written entirely in **C**, compiled with **GCC**.
- One top-level folder per lab (`DAA_Lab_01`, `DAA_Lab_02`, …).
- Inside each lab folder, one subfolder per question, named after the
  question itself (e.g. `Q1_Putting_them_in_order`, `Q4_Tower_of_Hanoi`),
  holding that question's `.c` file plus anything it generates.
- File names describe the problem, not just the question number — e.g.
  `Q4_tower_of_hanoi.c` rather than `q4.c`.
- Programs that study growth or performance write their measurements to a
  **CSV** file inside their own question folder, which is then plotted and
  committed as a **PNG** next to it.
- Plots are generated with a small Python + `matplotlib` script
  (`generate_plots.py`) that reads the CSVs — kept in the repo so any plot
  can be regenerated on demand.
- No external C libraries — only the C standard library (`stdio.h`,
  `stdlib.h`, `math.h`, `time.h`).

## Highlight — Q1 sidesteps overflow instead of hitting it

`Q1/Q1_order_of_growth.c` handles the trap built into the question paper
directly: three of the twelve functions (`n^(log2 n)`, `3^n`, and a naive
read of the `2^32·n` term) grow fast enough that evaluating them as raw
`double`s either overflows or drowns out every other function on a plot.

The fix is to compare `log2(f(n))` for each function instead of `f(n)`
itself — since `log2` is monotonically increasing, `log2(f(n)) < log2(g(n))`
if and only if `f(n) < g(n)`, so the ordering survives even when the raw
values wouldn't fit in a `double`. Sorting is done with the standard
library's `qsort` over these log2 values.

This also exposes the one deliberate trick in the question: `2^32·n` looks
exponential at a glance, but it is a **constant** (2³² ≈ 4.29 billion) times
`n` — still linear. Evaluated at `n = 10⁶`, it lands at `log2(f(n)) ≈ 51.9`,
comfortably inside the polynomial cluster and nowhere near `3^n` (`≈ 1.58
million`):

```text
Increasing order of growth (n = 10^6):
1/n  <  log2 n  <  n^0.51  <  12*sqrt(n)  <  50*sqrt(n)  <  n*log2(n)
     <  n^2-324  <  100n^2+6n  <  2^32*n  <  2n^3  <  n^(log2 n)  <  3^n
```

## Highlight — Q3 makes the O(nk²) vs O(nk log k) gap visible

`Q3_kway_merge.c` runs two experiments: fixing `n` and growing `k`, and
fixing `k` and growing `n`. The first is the interesting one — it is where
sequential merging's quadratic dependence on `k` actually shows up as a
number instead of staying a symbol in a proof.

At `n = 1000` fixed, going from `k = 2` to `k = 256` (a 128× increase in
`k`) makes sequential merging **~4300× slower** (16 µs → 68,788 µs), while
pairwise merging only grows **~840×** (13 µs → 10,887 µs) over the same
range — visibly sub-quadratic, tracking `O(nk log k)` instead of
`O(nk²)`. Both methods produce a correctly sorted array every time (checked
in-program with `is_sorted()`), so the divergence is purely about how the
work is scheduled, not correctness.

## Highlight — Q5 turns an O(n³) problem into O(n²) by exploiting structure

The matrices in Q5 aren't arbitrary: `M = [[M1, M2], [M2, M1]]`, and **M1 and
M2 have that same recursive pattern all the way down to single elements.**
That constraint means an `n×n` matrix of this type is fully described by
just `n` numbers, not `n²` — the block structure repeats, so most of the
matrix is redundant.

`Q5_special_pattern_multiplication.c` represents each matrix as a flat array
of `n` "leaf" values instead of an `n×n` grid, and multiplies two of them
using the recurrence `T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n)`, which solves to `Θ(n²)` by the
master theorem (the O(n) additions are polynomially smaller than the
`n^log₂4 = n²` term from the four recursive multiplications, so it's case 1).

The measured gap against brute-force `O(n³)` multiplication on the
*expanded* matrices is stark — at `n = 512`, the structured approach takes
**6.4 ms** against **128.6 ms** for brute force, a **~20× speedup that keeps
growing with n.** The structured version also happily continues to
`n = 2048` (**66.9 ms**), a size where a full `O(n³)` brute-force
multiplication was no longer practical to run for comparison.

Both algorithms were cross-checked by expanding the structured matrices to
full `n×n` grids and comparing entrywise — they agree at every size tested.

A few conclusions that fall out of the data:

- **Law of large numbers (Q2).** Over 1,000,000 tosses, the observed head
  frequency never drifts far from its programmed bias — the fair coin lands
  at **0.50038** against an expected 0.5, and a `p = 0.7` biased coin lands
  at **0.69989**.
- **Early termination only pays off on nearly-sorted input (Q3).** On random
  data at `n = 2000` the early-exit sort still needs **1,997,824**
  comparisons against **1,999,000** for the full-pass version — barely
  different, since a random array rarely finishes early. On already-sorted
  data at the same `n`, early-exit drops to just **1,999** comparisons
  versus **1,999,000** — a ~1000× difference. Both remain Θ(n²) in the worst
  case; the win is best-case only.
- **The recurrence is exact (Q4).** `T(n) = 2·T(n−1) + 1` solves to `2ⁿ − 1`,
  and the simulated move count matches the closed form for all 20 rows
  tested — 20 discs take exactly **1,048,575** moves.
- **Binary search wins decisively on the partition point (Q5).** On a
  1,000,000-element array, the linear scan needed **333,334** comparisons to
  find a boundary at index 333,333; binary search found the same boundary in

A few conclusions that fall out of the Lab 2 data:

- **Data-structure choice trades off which operation is cheap (Q1).** No
  structure wins everywhere: sorted array gives `O(log n)` search but
  `O(n)` insert/delete; doubly linked sorted list gives `O(1)`
  delete/max/min/predecessor/successor but `O(n)` search; unsorted array
  gives `O(1)` insert but `O(n)` everything that depends on order.
- **Both merge sort variants are `Θ(n log n)`, and the benchmark shows it
  (Q2).** At `n = 500,000`, 2-way merge sort averaged **52.2 ms** against
  **57.1 ms** for the 3-way variant over 5 trials — a ~9% constant-factor
  gap, not a different growth class; the log-log plot shows both curves
  running parallel.
- **Sequential k-way merging is quadratic in `k`, and it shows (Q3).** At
  `n = 1000` fixed, growing `k` from 2 to 256 makes sequential merging
  **~4300×** slower (16 µs → 68,788 µs) versus **~840×** for pairwise
  merging (13 µs → 10,887 µs) over the same 128× growth in `k` —
  `O(nk²)` against `O(nk log k)`, made visible rather than just asserted.

### DAA_Lab_03

A few conclusions that fall out of the Lab 3 data:

- **Binary search wins on real numbers, not just asymptotics (Q1).** At
  `n = 1,000,000`, binary search averaged **36.93** comparisons against
  **42.36** for ternary search — ternary's extra per-level comparison costs
  more than the extra split saves, exactly as the `1.26·log₂n` vs `log₂n`
  analysis predicts.
- **The coin weighings track `log₂n` almost exactly (Q2).** At `n = 100,000`
  coins, finding the defective coin (or confirming none exists) took just
  **16** weighings against `log₂(100,000) ≈ 16.6` — the divide-and-conquer
  halving keeps pace with the theoretical bound at every size tested.
- **D&C max-min beats the naive scan by a widening margin (Q3).** At
  `n = 131,072`, the D&C approach needed **196,606** comparisons against
  **262,142** for the naive scan — a fixed ~25% saving that holds at every
  size, matching the `3n/2` vs `2n` bounds exactly for every power of 2.
- **Strassen's crossover is visible, not just theoretical (Q4).** Below
  `n = 256`, brute force is competitive or faster (constant-factor overhead
  from the extra additions/subtractions dominates); by `n = 1024`, Strassen
  takes **663.9 ms** against **1006.5 ms** for brute force — Strassen has
  pulled ahead once the `O(n^2.807)` vs `O(n³)` gap outweighs its overhead.
- **Exploiting matrix structure turns O(n³) into O(n²), and it shows (Q5).**
  At `n = 512`, the structured approach takes **6.4 ms** against **128.6 ms**
  for brute force on the expanded matrices — a ~20× gap that grows with `n`,
  since only `n` values (not `n²`) describe the whole matrix.
- **Selection sort's best case is no better than its worst case (Q6).** A
  fully sorted input at `n = 10,000` still needed **49,995,000**
  comparisons — identical to the random-input case — because the inner loop
  always scans the entire remaining subarray with no early exit.

## Compilation and Execution

Each question lives in its own folder, so `cd` into it before compiling:

```bash
cd DAA_Lab_01/Q1_Putting_them_in_order
gcc -O2 -o Q1 Q1_order_of_growth.c -lm && ./Q1   # needs -lm (log2/pow/sqrt)

cd ../Q2_Fair_vs_Biased_Coin
gcc -o Q2 Q2_coin_toss.c && ./Q2

cd ../Q3_Performance_Analysis_of_bubble_sort
gcc -o Q3 Q3_bubble_sort.c && ./Q3

cd ../Q4_Tower_of_Hanoi
gcc -o Q4 Q4_tower_of_hanoi.c && ./Q4

cd ../Q5_Find_the_partition_point
gcc -o Q5 Q5_partition_point.c && ./Q5

cd ../Q6_Element_uniqueness
gcc -O2 -o Q6 Q6_element_uniqueness.c && ./Q6
```

Recommended flags while working:

```bash
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 file.c -o out -lm
```

**On Windows** (MinGW-w64), replace `-o Q1` with `-o Q1.exe` and run `Q1.exe`.

**Note on generated files.** Q1, Q3, and Q4 write their CSVs into the
_current working directory_ under a fixed name (`growth_order_data.csv`,
`bubble_sort_data.csv`, `bubble_sort_sorted_data.csv`, `hanoi_data.csv`).
Running them from inside their own question folder (as above) will overwrite the
committed copies there. Run from a scratch directory instead if you want to
keep those files untouched:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/daa && cd /tmp/daa
gcc "$OLDPWD/DAA_Lab_01/Q4_Tower_of_Hanoi/Q4_tower_of_hanoi.c" -o q4 && ./q4
```

To regenerate the plots after re-running the programs, run from
`DAA_Lab_01/` so the script can see every question folder:

```bash
cd DAA_Lab_01
pip install pandas matplotlib --break-system-packages
python3 generate_plots.py
```

### DAA_Lab_02

```bash
cd DAA_Lab_02/Q1_Dictionary_Operations
gcc -O2 -o Q1 Q1_dictionary_operations.c && ./Q1

cd ../Q2_Merge_sort_vs_Modified_merge_sort
gcc -O2 -o Q2 Q2_mergesort_comparison.c && ./Q2

cd ../Q3_Merging_k_sorted_arrays
gcc -O2 -o Q3 Q3_kway_merge.c && ./Q3
```

### DAA_Lab_03

```bash
cd DAA_Lab_03/Q1_Binary_vs_Ternary_Search

```bash
cd DAA_Lab_03
pip install pandas matplotlib --break-system-packages
python3 generate_plots.py
```

## Repository Conventions

- One top-level folder per lab, named `DAA_Lab_<nn>`, containing one subfolder per question.
- One subfolder per question, named `Q<number>_<question_title>` (e.g.
  `Q3_Performance_Analysis_of_bubble_sort`), holding that question's `.c`
  file plus anything it generates (CSV data, PNG plots).
- Sources are named `Q<number>_<short_description>.c`.
- Generated CSVs keep the name of the analysis they describe, and their
  plots share that name with a `.png` extension.
